The application is designed for keeping track of games that the user has completed and those that they still need to finish. The application was created using React Native and Firebase. As users, we can create our own account, add, delete, and edit games on our list. Additionally, the application provides the ability to search for games on the list and filter the list for games that we have finished or not. Adding games is supported by an API that allows us to select a game from a list while typing the title.
